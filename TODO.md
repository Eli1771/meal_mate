FOR MEAL PLAN GENERATOR

Count how many meals need to be selected
Pick percentage of NEW meals (20%?) from total, place randomly in plan
  Do this after to prevent tricky loading of remainer?
    Possibly generate whole plan, then replace 20% of meals with new
  How to choose which (b/l/d) meal?
Through scoping, organize meal database bases on ratings for chosen category
Select from top tier (star count) until it's gone, then move down

^^Where to insert bulk meal logic?

Make load animation on oven due to long ajax calls?
Replace database.yml timeout cheat with some implimentation of $.when() ajax?
